# Private Packagist Api Client

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6
* [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library,

## Install

Via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require private-packagist/api-client php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

Why `php-http/guzzle6-adapter`? We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with help by [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/).

## Basic usage of `private-packagist/api-client` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \PrivatePackagist\ApiClient\Client();
$client->authenticate('api-token', 'api-secret');
$packages = $client->packages()->all();
```

From `$client` object, you can access the full Private Packagist Api.
